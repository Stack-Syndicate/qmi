This project is in the very early stages of development and is nowhere near ready for use.

## Description

QMI is planned to be an extension of the usual ECS (Entity, Component, System) paradigm where Systems are categorised as either Queries, Mutations, or Interactions. This will hopefully allow for optimisations that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to implement upfront.
